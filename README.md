# Algorithms on graphs 

The graph generation is done with the help of gamma distribution. List of algorithms and methods that have been implemented in graph generation:

* Shimbell, 
* Dijkstra for negative weights,
* finding the number of routes from one vertex to another, 
* maximum route from one vertex to another, 
* depth-first search, 
* Ford-Falkerson, 
* finding the minimum cost flow, 
* Finding the number of hodgepodge trees in a graph, 
* Kraskal, 
* Prima facie, 
* finding the Eulerian cycle, encoding the hinge using the Pruefer code, 
* finding the Eulerian cycle,
* finding all Hamiltonian cycles,
* solving the traveling salesman problem.
